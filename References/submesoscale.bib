  Abstract                 = {High-resolution observations reveal the fast dynamics of submesoscale eddies in the coastal ocean. The eddies seem to play an important role in the ocean energy cascade and are thought to be important drivers for phytoplankton production. The eddies are frequently observed in the coastal and open ocean and are characterized by sharp gradients of 1°C/m and high Rossby numbers >10. In order to simultaneously resolve the short temporal and spatial scales of submesoscale eddies, an observational multi-platform approach with planes, a zeppelin, several vessels, gliders, and floats was used yielding a horizontal and vertical resolution of <1 m with repeat observations every 1 to 15 min. The Submesoscale Experiments (SubEx) took place off Catalina Island, CA, and off Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. Observations were carried out with aerial sea surface temperature and hyperspectral measurements, rapid in situ measurements with a towed instrument array, gliders with turbulence probes, as well as surface and subsurface velocity measurements with drifters, as well as Radar and Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers. Additional SAR, SST, and ocean color satellite imagery is used to investigate the occurrence of submesoscale eddies in the coastal ocean. The observations indicate intense mixing, turbulent dissipation, and subsequent restratification. The temperature distribution is closely linked to phytoplankton concentrations suggesting a strong bio-physical coupling.},

  Abstract                 = {Seasonal changes in the distribution of submesoscale (SM) flow features were examined using a fine-resolution numerical simulation. The SM flows are expected to be strong where mesoscale (MS) eddies actively develop and also when the mixed layer depth (MLD) is deep due to enhanced baroclinic instability. In the East Sea (ES), MS eddies more actively develop in summer while the MLD is deeper in winter, which provided the motivation to conduct this study to test the effects of MLD and MS eddies on the SM activity in this region. Finite-scale Liapunov exponents and the vertical velocity components were employed to analyze the SM activities. It was found that the SM intensity was marked by seasonality: it is stronger in winter when the mixed layer is deep but weaker in summer - despite the greater eddy kinetic energy. This is because in summer the mixed layer is so thin that there is not enough available potential energy. When the SM activity was quantified based on parameterization, (MLD {\texttimes} density gradient), it was determined that the seasonal variation of MLD plays a more important role than the lateral density gradient variation on SM flow motion in the ES.},

  Abstract                 = {High-resolution satellite images of ocean color and sea surface temperature reveal an abundance of ocean fronts, vortices and filaments at scales below 10 km but measurements of ocean surface dynamics at these scales are rare. There is increasing recognition of the role played by small scale ocean processes in ocean-atmosphere coupling, upper-ocean mixing and ocean vertical transports, with advanced numerical models and in situ observations highlighting fundamental changes in dynamics when scales reach 1 km. Numerous scientific publications highlight the global impact of small oceanic scales on marine ecosystems, operational forecasts and long-term climate projections through strong ageostrophic circulations, large vertical ocean velocities and mixed layer re-stratification. Small-scale processes particularly dominate in coastal, shelf and polar seas where they mediate important exchanges between land, ocean, atmosphere and the cryosphere, e.g., freshwater, pollutants. As numerical models continue to evolve toward finer spatial resolution and increasingly complex coupled atmosphere-wave-ice-ocean systems, modern observing capability lags behind, unable to deliver the high-resolution synoptic measurements of total currents, wind vectors and waves needed to advance understanding, develop better parameterizations and improve model validations, forecasts and projections. SEASTAR is a satellite mission concept that proposes to directly address this critical observational gap with synoptic two-dimensional imaging of total ocean surface current vectors and wind vectors at 1 km resolution and coincident directional wave spectra. Based on major recent advances in squinted along-track Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry, SEASTAR is an innovative, mature concept with unique demonstrated capabilities, seeking to proceed toward spaceborne implementation within Europe and beyond.},

  Abstract                 = {Submesoscale flows are energetic motions on scales of several kilometers that may lead to substantial vertical motions. Here we present satellite and ship radar as well as underway conductivity‐temperature‐depth and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler observations of a cyclonic submesoscale filament in the marginal ice zone of Fram Strait. The filament created a 500‐m thin and 50‐km long sea ice streak and extends to >250‐m depth with a negative/positive density anomaly within/below the halocline. The frontal jets of 0.5 m/s are in turbulent thermal wind balance while the ageostrophic secondary circulation in places appears to subduct Atlantic Water at >50 m/day. Our study reveals the submesoscale dynamics related to sea ice shapes that can be sensed remotely and shows how submesoscale dynamics contribute to shaping the marginal ice zone. It also demonstrates the co‐occurrence and mixing of water masses over short horizontal scales, which has implications for ocean and sea ice models and understanding of patch formation of planktonic organisms.},
