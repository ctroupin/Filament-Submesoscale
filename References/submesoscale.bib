  Abstract                 = {High-resolution observations reveal the fast dynamics of submesoscale eddies in the coastal ocean. The eddies seem to play an important role in the ocean energy cascade and are thought to be important drivers for phytoplankton production. The eddies are frequently observed in the coastal and open ocean and are characterized by sharp gradients of 1°C/m and high Rossby numbers >10. In order to simultaneously resolve the short temporal and spatial scales of submesoscale eddies, an observational multi-platform approach with planes, a zeppelin, several vessels, gliders, and floats was used yielding a horizontal and vertical resolution of <1 m with repeat observations every 1 to 15 min. The Submesoscale Experiments (SubEx) took place off Catalina Island, CA, and off Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. Observations were carried out with aerial sea surface temperature and hyperspectral measurements, rapid in situ measurements with a towed instrument array, gliders with turbulence probes, as well as surface and subsurface velocity measurements with drifters, as well as Radar and Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers. Additional SAR, SST, and ocean color satellite imagery is used to investigate the occurrence of submesoscale eddies in the coastal ocean. The observations indicate intense mixing, turbulent dissipation, and subsequent restratification. The temperature distribution is closely linked to phytoplankton concentrations suggesting a strong bio-physical coupling.},

  Abstract                 = {Satellite data (images of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a), ocean surface wind products, Lagrangian observations (surface drifters) and other ancillary data (upwelling index) are used to describe the upwelling seasons off NW Africa during 2009-2013, with particular focus on the coasts of Senegal and Mauritania. The impact of the upwelling is characterised by a comparative analysis, carried out in terms of wind-induced upwelling and water/ecosystem response to this forcing, of five geographical sectors detected in the study area. The wind forcing analysis shows the most favourable upwelling conditions in the period December-June in the southern sectors (south of 16 degrees N), and from February to October in the northern sectors (north of 18 degrees N). Southern sectors are strongly influenced by wind forcing, whereas to the north the upwelling also occurs during the months with low Ekman transport values. The analysis of the sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration confirms the existence of an upwelling season during winter-spring in the south, and emphasizes the different behaviours between the northern and southern sectors. Drifter tracks allow the addition of details about the flow of cold water offshore and alongshore. In particular, they describe the westward transport of cold water, by means of energetic filaments rooted at specific locations along the coast, north of Cape Vert and the south-SW ward transport of the coastal water south of Cape Vert.},
