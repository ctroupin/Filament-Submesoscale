# Filament-Submesoscale

Connecting the small scale processes and climate scenarios.

## Goal

How will the oceans change in the context of global warming?   

The ocean is complex, as many processes occupying at different spatial and temporal scales are taking place simultaneously and interacting with each other. The response of the ocean at large scales will differ from its response at the smaller scale.

Our interest here is the *submesoscale*, characterised by an ho
