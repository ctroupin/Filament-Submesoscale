      "    comment: 10-day Daily Cycle Land Surface Temperature (LST10-DC) provides a statistical overview of the LST daily cycle over each 10-day compositing for every image pixel. LST10-DC is useful for the scientific community, namely for those dealing with meteorological and climate models. Accurate values of LST are also of special interest in a wide range of areas related to land surface processes, including meteorology, hydrology, agrometeorology, climatology and environmental studies.\n",

The research leading to the current version of the product has received funding from various European Commission Research and Technical Development programs.
